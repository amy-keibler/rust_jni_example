# Rust + JNI Example

This repository contains the corresponding implementation from my blog article about integrating Rust code into a Java application.

## `graph-evaluator`

An example Rust library that accepts a graph as JSON, validates it, and then allows the user to perform calculations against it. It exists to be a demonstration of how one could have a moderately complex Rust library that could be wrapped via JNI to integrate into a Java application.
